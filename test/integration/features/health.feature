Feature: API proxy health
    As API administrator
    I want to ensure basic functionality is working
    So I can demonstrate the solution.

	@get-oas
    Scenario: Verify the Open API Spec is returned
        Given I set X-APIKey header to `clientId`
        When I GET /openapi
        Then response code should be 200
        And response header Content-Type should be application/json
        And response body path $.openapi should be 3.0.3
        And response body path $.info.version should be 0.0.1
        And response body path $.info.title should be Product Recommendations

    @get-products-no-cache
    Scenario: Verify a no-cache response
        Given I set X-APIKey header to `clientId`
        And I set Cache-Control header to no-cache
        When I GET /products
        Then response code should be 200
        And response header Content-Type should be application/json
        And response header Cache-Control should be no-cache
        And response body path $.products should be of type array

    @get-products-cache
    Scenario: Verify a cacheable response
        Given I set X-APIKey header to `clientId`
        When I GET /products
        Then response code should be 200
        And response header Content-Type should be application/json
        And response header Cache-Control should not be no-cache
        And response body path $.products should be of type array
